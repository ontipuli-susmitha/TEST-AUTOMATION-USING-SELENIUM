## CODTECH Internship - Task-1
"Company":CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

"Intern Name":ontipuli.susmitha

"Intern ID":CTIS2672

"Domain":Software Testing

"Duration": 4 Weeks

"Mentor": Neela Santosh

## Code description
CodTech Internship Task-1 focuses on test automation using Selenium WebDriver. In this task, the intern is required to automate the testing of a sample web application, mainly concentrating on the login functionality and basic navigation features. The task involves identifying web elements, entering valid credentials, performing login actions, and verifying successful navigation between different pages of the application. Selenium WebDriver is used to simulate real user interactions with the browser and validate the expected behavior of the application. The final deliverables include a repository containing the automation scripts and a test execution report that documents the test cases, execution results, and overall test status. This task helps interns gain practical experience in automation testing and understand how automated tools improve the efficiency and reliability of software testing.

## Objectives of the task
1.To understand the basics of automation testing.
2.To gain hands-on experience with Selenium WebDriver.
3.To automate the login functionality of a web application.
4.To validate navigation between web pages.
5.To learn how to identify and interact with web elements.
6.To reduce manual testing effort through automation.
7.To improve test accuracy and efficiency.
8.To create reusable and maintainable test scripts.
9.To understand test execution and result verification.
10.To document results using a test execution report.

## Tools and Technologies used
1.Selenium WebDriver – For automating web application testing
2.Programming Language – Java or Python (used to write automation scripts)
3.Web Browser – Google Chrome / Mozilla Firefox / Microsoft Edge
4.WebDriver – ChromeDriver / GeckoDriver (to control the browser)
5.IDE (Integrated Development Environment) – Eclipse / IntelliJ / Visual Studio Code
6.Test Framework – TestNG or JUnit (for test execution and reporting, if used)
7.Operating System – Windows / Linux / macOS
8.Version Control (Optional) – Git & GitHub for managing code

## Test Scenario covered
1.Open browser
2.Navigate to application URL
3.Enter username and password
4.Click login button
5.Verify successful login
6.Navigate to another page and verify navigation

## Screenshots captures
For submission, I capture these key screenshots, from the report
1.The first screenshot shows the Login Page of the web application.
2.Valid username and password are entered using Selenium automation.
3.The login action is successfully performed by clicking the Login button.
4.The second screenshot shows the Secure Area page after login.
5.A success message confirms that the user has logged in successfully.
These screenshots prove that the Selenium automation script executed correctly and validated the login functionality.

## Steps to execute the project
1.Install Java or Python on the system.
2.Install Selenium WebDriver.
3.Download and configure the required browser driver (ChromeDriver/GeckoDriver).
4.Set up an IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ / VS Code).
5.Create a new automation project.
6.Write Selenium test scripts for login functionality.
7.Provide the application URL in the script.
8.Locate web elements such as username, password, and login button.
9.Run the automation script from the IDE.
10.Observe the browser launching automatically.
11.Verify successful login by checking the Secure Area/Dashboard page.
12.Capture screenshots of the login page and secure page.
13.Record test execution results (Pass/Fail).
14.Save scripts and screenshots in the project folder.
